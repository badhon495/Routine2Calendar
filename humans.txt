/* PURPOSE */
This tool was created to help BRAC University students easily
export their class schedules to calendar applications.
BRACU doesn't provide direct calendar integration,
so this free tool bridges that gap.

Features:
- Convert BRACU schedules to ICS calendar files
- Export to Google Calendar
- Support for all major calendar apps
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time course data
- Customizable reminders

/* DEDICATION */
Made with ❤️ for BRACU students
Free and open source forever
