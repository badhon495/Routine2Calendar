# Favicon placeholder
# In production, you should replace this with a proper favicon.ico file
# You can generate one from your SVG icon using online tools like:
# - https://favicon.io/
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://www.favicon-generator.org/

# For now, the SVG favicon in the HTML works for modern browsers
# But a favicon.ico is still recommended for older browsers and better compatibility

# Instructions:
# 1. Convert your R2C logo SVG to a 32x32 PNG
# 2. Use an online ICO converter to create favicon.ico
# 3. Replace this file with the generated favicon.ico
# 4. Ensure it's in the root directory of your website
